For 1.5:
- server.c: move HTTP request/reply part and streaming part into seperate functions

For 1.6:
- Remove all global data?
- Display (configurable?) HTML page for brower (ie. non-player) requests
- Replace hard-coded error messages (and message boxes) by meaningful return codes
- CLEANUP in encoder.c: always refer to input buffer size as number of
  16-bit samples (instead of number of bytes)

Future:
- Windows Media Player plug-in
- Automatically transcode 8-bit samples to 16-bit samples
- Automatically transcode stereo to mono, if required
- Prove correctness of synchronization structures
